# Php-Duinocoin-Faucet-script-
This is a PHP Duinocoin Faucet Script self created by Gamecat999 and lovely AI assistance(mostly Gamecat). 
To Run this faucet you will need a host that supports PHP. Believe me, i have tried and found 0 free hosting services available that will work. 
Best is to self host.
I will provide help if i can about the script on request sooooo yeah.
This scripts implements a basic Cooldown and pretty much a basic UI. You probably want to upgrade it A LOT
if you plan on self hosting make sure that openssl is initiated in your php.ini file.
